SoundVitrine is a web-app that hosts your local music library metadata. **It's like a reverse Spotify** !

- Using [SoundBuddy](https://github.com/Amphaal/SoundBuddy) - its app counterpart - you can securely publish your 10k+ tunes library online in a matter of millisecondsâš¡
- Thanks to [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events), you automatically broadcast to visitors what you are listening to in live on iTunes ðŸ¤¯

## About
This personal project is quite old, and started as an idea back in 2018.

As a music enthusiast, I always had tons and tons of new music that I downloaded regularly on my computer, and liked having them tightly ordered, with album covers. 

Back then, music pure player like Deezer or Spotify did not have a complete enough library (especially considering my music tastes !) to justify switching to those, so I kept my iTunes library growing.

As I always wanted to tell about my discoveries to my friends when I was outside but frequently forgot about band names and titles, I thought about building what became **SoundVitrine** !

  <i>As of 2025, I ended up with a massive library (almost 30k, 240+ Go)</i>
