SoundVitrine is a web-app that hosts your local music library metadata. **It's like a reverse Spotify** !

- Using [SoundBuddy](https://github.com/Amphaal/SoundBuddy) - its app counterpart - you can securely publish your 10k+ tunes library online in a matter of millisecondsâš¡
- Thanks to HTTP's [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) enabled by [Mercure](https://mercure.rocks/), you automatically broadcast to visitors what you are listening to in live on iTunes ðŸ¤¯

## About
This personal project is quite old, and started as an idea back in 2018.

As a music enthusiast, I always had tons and tons of new music that I downloaded regularly on my computer, and liked having them tightly ordered, with album covers. 

Back then, music pure player like Deezer or Spotify did not have a complete enough library (especially considering my music tastes !) to justify switching to those, so I kept my iTunes library growing.

As I always wanted to tell about my discoveries to my friends when I was outside but frequently forgot about band names and titles, I thought about building what became **SoundVitrine** !

<div align="center">
  <i>As of 2025, I ended up with a massive library (almost 30k, 240+ Go)</i>

## Technologies used
> [!NOTE]
> The legacy technologies / techniques that are used on this Proof-of-Concept project are not par with industry standards - refactorization efforts are welcome https://github.com/Amphaal/SoundVitrine/issues/14 !

- Plain old HTML5 + CSS3 animations (w/ [animate.css](https://animate.style/) & [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/))
- PHP, leveraging Compose for external JWT implementation & code-smell detection
- Vanilla Javascript, alongside 
    - [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com/) for graphs
    - [Mixitup](https://github.com/patrickkunka/mixitup) for DOM animations
    - [Hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) for gesture handling
    - [SortTable](https://github.com/stuartlangridge/sorttable), for table sorting obviously
    - [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) for time
- [PHPFranken](https://frankenphp.dev/) w/ Mercure for a self-contained Docker app with SEE events handling
- MusicBrainz API (https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API)

## Using SoundVitrine
> [!TIP]
> - Using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is strongly advised, and we assume you are using it in this documentation. Some extensions will also be automatically recommended to you to ease debuging and coding.
> - We also assume you are familiar with `git` and have cloned the repo on your machine. 
> - Being familiar with `docker` and `docker-compose.yml` file format is also highly recommanded if you wish to deploy the app yourself.


### Debugging / Using locally
- In the `Execute and Debug` VSCode's left panel, please run `1) Run - Docker Compose` configuration.
    - It will require a docker image build, so it might take a few seconds the first time you run it; please wait !
    - In almost all cases, `1a) Bind XDebug` configuration should not be ran independently since it will be automatically launched for breakpoints to work.
- Once you notice `server running` in `1) Run - Docker Compose`'s terminal log, you can run `2) Open SoundVitrine locally` to launch the app.

### Hosting / Deploying
Since the app is self-contained, hosting is quite simple. Check https://github.com/Amphaal/SoundVitrine/tree/main/.dev/docker-compose.prod-example.yml for a non-debug configuration example. We strongly suggest you to change environments variables defaults by populating an `.env` files with required parameters.
